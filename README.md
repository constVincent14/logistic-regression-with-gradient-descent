# logistic-regression-with-gradient-descent
In the previous repository, we use gradient descent for linear regression problem. But, gradient descent could also work well with logistic regression for binary classification problem. In this repository, I've created two modules: 1) logistic regression without regularization (logitreg); 2) logistic regression with regularization (reglogitreg). Regularized logistic regression is very useful to avoid overfitting when we have a large set of features or polynomial features, it'll pushed down or penalized feature(s) that aren't useful for prediction. In other terms, coefficient of a feature that has minimum predictive power will be pushed down.
